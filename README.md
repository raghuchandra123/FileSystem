I have created Update, Download, upload and delete AIP's with unit testing. But front end part is not done. Because I have no experiance in that.
A sample result Below. 
Also I have just delt with the happy flow.

TechnologiesUsed : Java, Springboot, MySql, AWS S3.

Node : By the time you run the code the sql account will get expired. Please feel to change the account in application file.
